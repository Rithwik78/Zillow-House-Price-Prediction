Five steel beams project in two directions allowing the house to ""float"" above the challenging hillside lot, while preserving the natural beauty of a site that commands a magnificent panoramic view of the San Francisco Bay.   Constructed around the pinnacle of a rock outcrop that projects through the center of the house into the music room, it is here that the Dave Brubeck Quartet practiced, and where monumental hits like “Take Five” were composed.  Dave Brubeck and his ""tree house"" were widely featured in publications of the day and Thorne's ambitious design captured the imagination of the post-war American public.
